 <h3>Women in Tech Spotlight</h3>
<h1> Aanika Patel & Jenna Patel </h1>
  </div> 

  <p>My name is Aanika Patel, I am 14 years old and live in Sann Jose, CA. I am in incoming freshman at Saint Francis High School. A couple of my favoirte things to do is to play soccer and dance. One thing I have learned from working with a gorup of girls for 2 weeks is that communication is key. I had a great time learning from my other peers at Girls Who Code. I hope to contunie and grow my comoputer scinece skills. Because computer science is moslty a male-dominated field, I think it is really important that young women like us get our voice out there. My advice for other young women is to be brave and put yourslef out there becuase you can do whatever you set your mind to.>
<p>My name is Jenna Patel. I am 16 years old and will be a sophomore in the 2017-2018 school year. I love to play the piano, in addition to playing soccer. One thing I learned from Girls Who Code is that communication and working together in a team in key to coding. In addition, problem-solving and debugging occurs frequently with coding. In the future, I hope to continue to learn computer science and broaden. my knowledge and capability to code. For other girls who are interested in coding, I would say that they should not be afraid to try and code. In addition, they should not be afraid to speak their mind. </p>
